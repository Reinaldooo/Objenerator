## Objenerator


Objenerator allows you to create random but customizable Javascript objects, or Python dictionaries.

It will create an array with the number of objects that you selected.

As a React developer we always need an array of objects to test components, so this comes in handy.

To use the tool, you just need to go the website: [Objenerator](https://objenerator.netlify.com/)

If you want to help Objenerator grow, pull requests are welcomed.
